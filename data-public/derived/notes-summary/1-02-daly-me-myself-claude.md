# 1-02: Me, Myself, and Claude

**One-Sentence Summary**: Jasmine Daly demonstrates how AI assistance fundamentally shifts consulting from "Can I do it?" to "How to understand client outcomes and constraints," with weekend-to-CRAN package development (avilstr) proving AI-accelerated workflows free mental bandwidth for strategic thinking rather than creating laziness.

**Speaker**: Jasmine Daly, Principal Consultant & Founder, Daly Analytics | [Slides](https://dalyanalytics.github.io/me-myself-claude-talk/)

**Importance Rank**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
- **Tools/Concepts**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (shinyfa, avilstr packages; GitHub Actions + Supabase + Quarto stack)
- **Immediate Applicability**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Manager-developer mental model; template-driven workflows)
- **Novel Techniques**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Consulting practice evolution; right-sized enterprise infrastructure)

## Key Insights from Human Notes

**Practice Evolution**: Fundamental shift from technical feasibility ("Can I do it?") to strategic alignment ("How to understand client outcomes and constraints"). With AI handling technical execution, consultant value centers on requirements translation, business context, and outcome optimization.

**Mental Model**: "I'm the manager, copilot is my developer" with human-in-the-loop approach. Human provides context, constraints, and quality control; AI provides rapid implementation and technical execution.

**Cognitive Liberation**: "When AI frees up your mental bandwidth, you don't get lazy - you get strategic" (with personality-dependent caveats). Mental energy redirects toward business strategy, client outcomes, and innovation when routine technical tasks are AI-handled.

## Tools & Resources

**Primary Packages**:
- **shinyfa**: Shiny FA (File Analysis) functionality | Demonstrates AI-assisted package development
- **avilstr**: Weekend-to-CRAN package | `install.packages("avilstr")` | Exemplifies rapid prototyping capabilities

**Infrastructure Stack**:
- **GitHub Actions**: Data orchestration and workflow automation
- **Supabase**: Database and backend services
- **Quarto**: Client dashboards for data visualization
- **Template System**: Standardized, reusable components for faster delivery

**Key Workflow**: GitHub Actions → Supabase → Quarto dashboard → Template system (right-sized enterprise-grade modern DevOps)

## Methods & Techniques for Research Analytics

**Applicable Methods**:
1. **AI-Assisted Package Development**: Rapid prototyping and CRAN submission workflows (weekend timeline possible)
2. **Manager-Developer Framework**: Human strategic oversight with AI technical execution
3. **Right-Sized Infrastructure**: Modern toolchain appropriate to client scale (not over-engineered)
4. **Template-Driven Development**: Reusable components accelerate project delivery while maintaining quality

**Research Workflow Applications**:
- Accelerated R package development for specialized analytical tools
- Right-sized data infrastructure for research projects (GitHub + Supabase + Quarto)
- Template systems for reproducible analysis pipelines
- Strategic focus on research questions while AI handles implementation details

## Priority Follow-Up Actions

**🚨 IMMEDIATE**:
- [ ] Review avilstr package development process as case study
- [ ] Study GitHub Actions + Supabase + Quarto integration patterns
- [ ] Develop manager-developer mental model for current AI-assisted workflows
- [ ] Create template library for common research analytics tasks
