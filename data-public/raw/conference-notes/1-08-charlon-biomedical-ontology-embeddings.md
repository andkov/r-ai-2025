## Abstract/Summary

**"Biomedical ontology dictionary creation with embeddings and local LLMs"**

*[Abstract content to be added during the presentation]*

## Conference Context

This presentation follows Max Kuhn's "Analyzing LLM Evaluations" and precedes Umair Durrani's "Brand your docs, apps, and ggplots using LLMs".
