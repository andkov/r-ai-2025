# Building a Better R AI Assistant: A Multi-Agent Approach

**Speaker:** Pawel Rucki (Roche)  
**Time:** 12:30-1:05 PM  
**Date:** November 12, 2025  
**Session:** 1-05  

## Abstract/Summary

*[To be filled during talk - official description of the presentation]*

## Conference Context

This presentation follows Garrick Aden-Buie's "Tools for LLMs and Humans who use R" and precedes Mohamed El Fodil Ihaddaden's "mini007 - A Lightweight Framework for Multi-Agent Orchestration in R", positioning it within a sequence focusing on AI tooling and multi-agent systems in the R ecosystem.

## Key Points & Analysis

*[Live notes during presentation]*

### Main Concepts

**Core Design Principle: One Agent = One Package**
- Each agent in the multi-agent system corresponds to a single R package
- Modular architecture where agents have specialized roles tied to package functionality
- ⚠️ **Note:** This is proprietary work - not open source implementation

### Technical Approach
