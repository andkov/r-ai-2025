## Conference Context
- **Event**: R+AI 2025 - R Consortium Conference focusing on AI integration with R
- **Program Position**: Day 1, second talk after opening keynote
- **Duration**: 35-minute session
- **Theme**: Personal perspective on human-AI collaboration in R development

## Key Points & Analysis

### 1. Personal Perspective on AI Collaboration
*Discussion of human-AI interaction from a personal standpoint*

### 2. Claude's Role in R Development
Jasmine Daly's perspective on how Claude (Anthropic's AI) integrates into R programming workflows and data science consulting practice

### 3. Personal Consulting Experience
Insights from running Daly Analytics and incorporating AI assistance into professional R development and client work

#### Fundamental Shift in Consulting Practice
- **Traditional Focus**: "Can I do it?" - Technical feasibility was the primary constraint
- **AI-Enhanced Focus**: "How to understand client's outcomes and constraints" - Strategic alignment becomes paramount
- **Implication**: With AI assistance removing many technical barriers, the consultant's value shifts to understanding business context, requirements translation, and outcome optimization

#### Mental Model for AI Collaboration
- **Human Role**: Manager/Architect - providing direction, strategy, and oversight
- **AI Role**: Developer/Implementer - executing technical tasks under human guidance
- **Framework**: "Human in the loop" - maintaining human oversight and decision-making authority
- **Division of Labor**: Human provides context, constraints, and quality control; AI provides rapid implementation and technical execution

#### Mental Bandwidth and Strategic Thinking
- **Core Insight**: "When AI frees up your mental bandwidth, you don't get lazy - you get strategic"
- **Cognitive Liberation**: AI handling routine technical tasks allows focus on higher-level thinking
- **Strategic Elevation**: Mental energy redirected toward business strategy, client outcomes, and innovation
- **Personality Caveat**: This strategic elevation may depend on individual personality types and intrinsic motivation patterns
- **Note**: Not all professionals may naturally transition to strategic thinking when technical constraints are removed

### 4. R Package Development with AI Assistance
Key examples of rapid package development:

#### shinyfa Package
- **Purpose**: FA (File Analysis) functionality for Shiny applications
- **Context**: Demonstrates AI-assisted R package development

- Implications for research software development and reproducibility

### Quality vs. Speed Trade-offs
- Maintaining package quality standards while achieving rapid development
- CRAN acceptance criteria met despite compressed timeline
- Questions about long-term maintenance and sustainability

### Consulting Practice Evolution
- **Pre-AI Consulting**: Focus on technical capability and implementation feasibility
- **AI-Enhanced Consulting**: Focus shifts to strategic understanding and outcome alignment
- **New Value Proposition**: Consultants become translators between business needs and AI-accelerated technical solutions
- **Client Relationship Changes**: More emphasis on requirements gathering, constraint identification, and success metrics definition

### Cognitive Impact of AI Assistance
- **Mental Bandwidth Liberation**: AI handling technical execution frees cognitive resources for strategic thinking
- **Behavioral Outcomes**: Instead of becoming lazy, practitioners can become more strategic and innovative
- **Individual Variation**: The transition to strategic thinking may depend on personality type and intrinsic motivation
- **Professional Development**: Requires conscious effort to redirect freed mental capacity toward higher-value activities
- **Selection Effect**: May favor professionals with strategic inclinations and business-oriented mindsets

### Human-AI Collaboration Models
- Practical examples of effective human-AI partnerships in software development
- Insights into optimal division of labor between human expertise and AI assistance
- Templates for other researchers to adopt similar approaches

#### Manager-Developer Mental Model
- **Human as Manager**: Strategic oversight, requirements definition, quality assurance
- **AI as Developer**: Code generation, implementation, documentation assistance
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Continuous oversight ensures quality and alignment with business objectives
- **Scalability**: Allows consultants to take on more complex projects with faster delivery

#### Enterprise Infrastructure Approach
- **Right-sizing Philosophy**: Building solutions appropriate to client scale and needs
- **Modern Toolchain Integration**: GitHub Actions + Supabase + Quarto + Template Systems
- **Template-driven Development**: Reusable components accelerate project delivery
- **Professional Standards**: Maintaining enterprise-grade quality despite accelerated timelines

## Questions for Further Investigation
1. What specific methodologies does Daly Analytics use for AI-assisted R development?
2. How does the consulting business model adapt to AI-enhanced productivity?
3. What are the client perceptions of AI-assisted deliverables?
6. How do consultants develop skills in understanding client outcomes and constraints when technical execution becomes commoditized?
7. What new consulting frameworks emerge when "Can I do it?" is no longer the limiting question?
4. How does this approach scale across different types of R projects?
5. What quality control measures are used in AI-assisted development?
